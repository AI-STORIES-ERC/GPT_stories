**Title: The Last Olive Tree**

**Setting: A small village near the outskirts of Taiz, Yemen, 2023**

As the sun dipped behind the rugged mountains encircling Al-Hawban, its rays spilled golden light over the arid landscape, illuminating a single olive tree standing proud amid the ruins of what was once a lush garden. The tree, gnarled and weathered, was a relic of a different time, a time before conflict had ravaged landscapes and homes. It stood as a silent witness to the struggles of the families that had once thrived in its shade.

In the village of Al-Hawban, life had been drastically altered by years of war. The people there had endured countless hardships—loss of family, destruction of homes, and the constant fear of airstrikes. Yet, amid the despair, the olive tree remained a symbol of resilience for the villagers, particularly for a young girl named Layla.

Layla was ten years old, with wide, curious eyes that absorbed the world around her. She had never known peace, only the echo of gunfire and the distant rumble of aircraft. However, her spirit was undeterred. Every afternoon, she would sit beneath the ancient olive tree, sketching in her worn notebook, her imagination a refuge from the harshness of reality. She drew the beauty she wished to see in the world—a world where laughter replaced gunfire, and the scent of blooming flowers filled the air instead of smoke.

One day, as Layla sat under the olive tree, she noticed an unfamiliar figure approaching. It was a boy around her age, his clothes tattered and dusty. He had dark hair and a shy smile that peeked through his uncertainty.

“Hello,” he said, his voice barely above a whisper.

“Hi,” Layla replied, her heart racing with a mix of excitement and apprehension. She had rarely met new people since the war began.

“I’m Amir,” he introduced himself, taking a cautious step closer. “I came from a village near here.”

“Why are you here?” Layla asked, intrigued.

“My family had to leave. Our village was destroyed,” Amir said, looking down at the ground. “I wanted to find a place to rest and… to draw.” 

Layla’s eyes lit up. “You draw? I do too!” She opened her notebook to reveal her sketches of the olive tree, birds, and the mountains surrounding them.

Amir’s face brightened as he took a seat beside her. “Can I see?”

As Layla shared her drawings, Amir revealed his own sketches—simple but heartfelt portrayals of his family, the home he lost, and the dreams he still clung to. They spent hours exchanging stories and art, finding solace in the shared experience of loss and hope. For Layla, Amir was a reminder that connection still existed in a world torn apart.

Days turned into weeks, and each afternoon, Amir visited Layla. They became inseparable as they sketched the world around them—the vibrant colors of the sunset, the stark beauty of the mountains, and the resilience of the olive tree. They even began to plan a mural to honor their families and the village they hoped to rebuild someday.

One afternoon, as they painted their mural on the cracked wall of an abandoned house, the serenity was shattered by the sound of distant explosions. Layla froze, her heart sinking. Amir, sensing her fear, took her hand. “We have to keep going. We can’t let them take our hope.”

With determination, they continued to paint. They infused their mural with colors of hope—green for the olive leaves, blue for the sky, and gold for the sun. As they worked, they spoke of their dreams: a world where children could play without fear, where families could gather, and where the olive tree could bear fruit once more.

But reality was relentless. One evening, as they finished their mural, the sky darkened ominously. It wasn’t long before the familiar sound of warplanes filled the air. Layla and Amir exchanged worried glances, knowing that the danger was closer than ever.

“Layla, you should go home,” Amir urged, his voice trembling slightly. “It’s not safe here.”

“I can’t leave you,” Layla replied, her fear transforming into defiance. “We’re in this together.”

As the first bomb fell, the ground shook beneath them. They ran towards the olive tree, the only thing that felt safe and familiar in that moment. Layla could hear the chaos and cries around them, but all she could focus on was the tree—their sanctuary. They huddled beneath its branches, holding onto each other as the world crumbled above.

When the noise finally subsided, they emerged from their hiding spot, disoriented but alive. The mural they had created was now smeared and damaged, but the olive tree stood resilient, its branches still stretching towards the sky.

“Look,” Amir said, pointing at the tree. “It’s still here. Just like us.”

In that moment of despair, they found strength in each other and in the olive tree’s enduring presence. They knew that they had to keep fighting—not just for their own hopes, but for the memories of those they had lost.

With renewed determination, they decided to plant seeds around the olive tree, seeds of hope for a future they dreamed of. They gathered what little they could find: scraps of old cans, pieces of wood, and soil from the ground. Together, they planted the seeds, whispering their hopes and dreams into the earth.

As the days turned into weeks, Layla and Amir continued their small acts of defiance—painting murals, planting seeds, and sharing stories of their families. They became a symbol of resilience in the village, inspiring others to join them in their efforts. Slowly, the community began to unite, finding strength in their shared experiences. 

They organized gatherings beneath the olive tree, where families shared meals, stories, and laughter. The tree became a haven, a place of healing amid the chaos. As people began to rebuild their lives, they also worked to restore the gardens that had once flourished in Al-Hawban.

As the seasons changed, so did the landscape around them. The seeds that Layla and Amir had planted began to sprout, tiny green shoots emerging from the soil. It was a small miracle, a testament to their hope and determination. The olive tree, once a solitary figure against the backdrop of war, now stood amidst a growing garden, surrounded by laughter and life.

One sunny afternoon, as Layla and Amir sat beneath the olive tree, they watched children play and families reconnect. “Look at what we’ve done,” Amir said, his voice full of awe.

Layla smiled, her heart swelling with pride. “It’s just the beginning. There’s still so much more to do.”

As they spoke, a gentle breeze rustled through the olive tree’s branches, its leaves shimmering like silver in the sunlight. In that moment, they both understood that while the scars of war would remain, so too would their resilience and hope. They were part of a larger story—one of survival, connection, and the enduring spirit of community.

In Al-Hawban, the last olive tree stood tall, not just as a reminder of what had been lost, but as a beacon of hope for all that was yet to come. And under its shade, Layla and Amir continued to dream, sketch, and nurture a future where peace and joy would one day take root once more.
