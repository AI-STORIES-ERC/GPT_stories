**Title: The Last Mango of Summer**

**I. Introduction**

The sun dipped low over the horizon, painting the sky in hues of orange and pink, as it prepared to bid farewell to another day on the island of Barbados. The scent of saltwater mingled with the sweet aroma of ripe mangoes wafting through the air. It was late summer, a time when the island was alive with laughter, music, and the warmth of friendships. For young Tia, the season held a special significance; it wasn’t just the end of summer—it was the time for her family’s annual mango feast.

**II. The Mango Feast**

Every year, the Williams family gathered under the old tamarind tree in their backyard, a sprawling sanctuary where laughter echoed through the leaves. The centerpiece of the celebration was the mango—a fruit that held stories of love, loss, and legacy. Tia's grandmother, Maureen, often recounted how her father had planted the mango tree when she was just a little girl. “This tree has seen generations grow, and it will see many more,” she would say, her voice filled with nostalgia.

Tia, now a bright-eyed sixteen, relished these stories. She would sit with her cousins, listening intently as Maureen spoke of the best mangoes in the region—the juicy, golden ones that dripped with sweetness, perfect for the feast. They would all gather, competing to find the largest mango, a challenge that had become a family tradition. But this year was different; it was the last summer before Tia would leave for university abroad.

**III. A Mysterious Stranger**

As the preparations for the feast began, Tia noticed a stranger wandering near their yard. He was a tall man with curly hair and sun-kissed skin, wearing a faded shirt and a pair of shorts. He stood at the edge of the property, staring at the mango tree with an intensity that caught Tia’s attention. Curiosity piqued, she approached him.

“Hello!” she called out, waving her hand. “Can I help you with something?”

The man turned, surprise flickering across his face. “I’m just admiring your mango tree,” he replied, a hint of a smile breaking through his reserved demeanor.

Tia learned that his name was Caleb, a traveler from Canada who had come to Barbados to explore its beauty. “I’ve heard so much about the mangoes here,” he added. “I’ve been searching for the best ones, and this tree looks like it has a story.”

Tia beamed with pride. “It does! This tree has been in my family for generations. We’re having a mango feast tomorrow. You’re welcome to join us if you’d like.”

**IV. The Feast Begins**

The next day, the air was thick with anticipation. Tia’s family gathered around the old tamarind tree, setting up tables laden with dishes that celebrated the mango in all its glory—mango chutney, mango salad, and the pièce de résistance: mango sorbet. The atmosphere buzzed with chatter and laughter, and the rhythmic beats of calypso music filled the air.

Caleb arrived just as Tia’s grandmother began to tell the story of the mango tree. Everyone welcomed him warmly, and he felt an immediate connection to the vibrant energy of the family. As the sun began to set, casting a golden glow over the gathering, Caleb shared tales of his travels, captivating Tia and her cousins with stories from faraway lands.

As the feast progressed, Tia found herself drawn to Caleb. They shared a bond over their love for adventure, and their laughter echoed through the yard, mingling with the sounds of joy surrounding them. When it came time for the mango competition, the excitement reached a fever pitch.

**V. The Mango Challenge**

The challenge was simple: each participant had to find the largest mango from the tree. Tia and her cousins raced toward the branches, climbing and reaching for the fruit, their laughter ringing out like music. Caleb joined in, a playful determination in his eyes.

After what felt like hours of searching, Tia spotted it—a massive mango, glistening in the fading sunlight, just within reach. With a triumphant yell, she grabbed the fruit and held it high above her head. “I found the biggest mango!” she exclaimed, her heart racing.

But just as she turned to celebrate, she slipped on a stray mango pit that had fallen on the ground. Time slowed as she lost her balance. Caleb, quick on his feet, dashed toward her. He caught her just in time, their laughter mingling with the rustling leaves of the mango tree.

“Careful there, Tia!” he chuckled, a twinkle in his eye. “You wouldn’t want to miss out on the feast.”

**VI. A Sweet Goodbye**

As twilight descended, the family gathered around the table, now illuminated by strings of fairy lights. They shared stories, relished the food, and enjoyed each other’s company. For Tia, this summer feast was more than just a celebration; it was a bittersweet farewell to her childhood and the island she loved.

Caleb sat beside her, sharing moments of connection and laughter. “You know,” he said, “I’ve traveled to many places, but there’s something special about this island. The warmth of the people, the beauty of the landscapes—the mango tree symbolizes it all.”

Tia nodded, feeling a pang of sadness at the thought of leaving. “I’ll miss this place,” she confessed. “But I want to carry this spirit with me wherever I go.”

Caleb smiled, a knowing look in his eyes. “And you will. Just like the seeds of the mango, you’ll plant your experiences and let them grow.”

As the night wore on, Tia felt a sense of hope mingling with her melancholy. She realized that while she was leaving Barbados, she would carry the memories of the mango tree, the laughter, and the kindness of strangers turned friends in her heart.

**VII. A New Beginning**

The following morning, the sun rose slowly, casting a warm glow over the island. Tia stood at the edge of her backyard, gazing at the mango tree. With a heavy heart, she picked one last mango, the largest she could find. She took a deep breath, savoring the sweet scent, and held it tightly.

“Thank you,” she whispered to the tree, feeling a wave of peace wash over her. “For the memories, for the stories, and for this beautiful summer.”

As she turned to leave, she spotted Caleb walking toward her, a mango in hand. “I thought you might like to have this,” he said, his smile brightening the morning. “A little piece of Barbados to take with you.”

Tia’s heart swelled. “Thank you, Caleb. This means a lot.” She glanced back at the tree one last time, feeling a connection that transcended distance. “I’ll never forget this summer or the friends I’ve made.”

**VIII. Conclusion**

As Tia boarded the plane that would take her to a new life abroad, she clutched the mango tightly. It was a symbol of home, a reminder of the laughter and love she had shared with her family and friends. The mango would accompany her on her journey, a sweet token of the island she would always call home.

In the years that followed, Tia often found herself reminiscing about that summer—the mango feast, the stories under the tamarind tree, and the unexpected friendship with Caleb. And whenever she savored a mango in her new home, she would close her eyes and let the flavors transport her back to the sun-soaked days of Barbados, where the spirit of the mango tree lived on in her heart.
