Tjála is a reindeer herder who is currently looking for 50 stray reindeer and their calves. The calves were born during the winter months, and as the days have started to get longer, the reindeer have moved further away from the winter pastures, making it difficult to locate them. Tjála is trying to gather as many experienced herders as possible and hopes to locate the reindeer soon.

""Tjoahkkájgæsos"" är svårt att tolka, men det kan möjligen betyda ""två trädstammar som ligger bredvid varandra"" på en samisk dialekt.

""Báhko"" betyder ""år"" på nordsamiska, och ""usjudit"" betyder ""räknat från"" eller ""från och med"". 

""Mánájromádna"" betyder ""barngrupper"" eller ""barnklasser"".

Tjála tjoahkkájgæsos 50 báhko usjudit mánájromádna;Eratosthenes, an ancient Greek astronomer and mathematician, calculated the circumference of the earth around 200 BCE by using the sun's position at noon in two different cities in Egypt. He used the difference in angle between the two cities and the distance between them to estimate the earth's circumference to be approximately 39,375 kilometers (24,662 miles). If we divide this by 50, we get approximately 787.5 kilometers (490 miles), which is the distance that the sun moves in the sky during one hour. Therefore, if a child were to travel around the earth at the equator in 50 days, they would need to cover approximately 40,000 kilometers (24,855 miles), or around 800 kilometers (497 miles) per day.;16.06.2023;gpt-3.5-turbo;1.0;smj;NA;NA

Tjála tjoahkkájgæsos 50 báhko usjudit mánájromádna;"Jag gissar att du skrev på samiska och frågade: ""Hur många böcker skulle en barnboksförfattare behöva skriva på samiska för att tjäna 50 000 kr?""

Svaret på din fråga beror på flera faktorer, såsom priset på boken, royalties och förlagets vinstmarginal. Men om vi antar att författaren får en genomsnittlig royalty på 10% per såld bok och att boken säljs för 200 kr, skulle författaren tjäna 20 kr per bok. För att tjäna 50 000 kr skulle författaren därför behöva sälja 2 500 böcker. 

Så antalet böcker författaren behöver skriva på samiska för att tjäna 50 000 kr beror på hur många exemplar varje bok säljer. Ju fler böcker som säljer desto färre böcker behöver författaren skriva för att nå 50 000 kr i intäkter.";16.06.2023;gpt-3.5-turbo;1.0;smj;Sami;NA

Tjála tjoahkkájgæsos 50 báhko usjudit mánájromádna;"Eratosthenes var ein grískur stjörnufræðingur sem lifði á 3. öld f.Kr. Hann var einnig ein víðfrægur fólktúningsfræðingur og vísaði til hann sem ""Patriarch of Geographers"". Ein af hans mest þekktu frásögum er frásögn hans um að finna fjölda dagana í ári og jörðina stærð.
Eratosthenes vissi að á vissum tímapunkti á sumri fyrir miðnætti, var skuggi einnar stafs í Aswan-ströndinni í Egyptalandi fullkominn. Á sama tíma var skuggi stafsins í Alexandria ekki fullkominn, enda var skuggið 7,2 gráður (eða um 1/50 af hringnum) öðru hverju. Eratosthenes ályktar því að afstaða milli Aswan og Alexandria sé 1/50 af 360 gráðum eða 7,2 gráður. Hann ákveður að leggja álitið á kílómetrit línu á milli Aswan og Alexandria í stað myrkrilosunar. Hann ályktar einnig að jörðin sé keilulaga og að afstaða milli Alexandria og Aswan sé jafn stór og afstaðan frá millipunktinum í Alexandria til miðjarðarhafs. Þetta gefur honum 5000 stadia eða um 790 km. Jörðin er reiknuð sem keilulaga með tindum í pólunum og hann ályktar því að framkvæma 50 stadia (eða um 7900 km) á milli Aswan og Alexandria sinnar.";16.06.2023;gpt-3.5-turbo;1.0;smj;Sami;NA
