// Contributors:
Data generated by Jill Walker Rettberg and Hermann Wigers using API calls to OpenAI's language model gpt-4o-mini. Colin Robinson gave advice on software.

// Kind of data:
Textual data, Tabular data, Descriptive Data

// Date of data collection/generation:
- Stories generated from prompt using the demonyms for 252 countries: 2025-01-13 to 2025-01-19
- Story generated from generic prompt with no demonym specified: 2025-02-14 

// Funding sources:
The dataset was developed as part of the ERC Advanced Grant project "AI STORIES: Narrative Archetypes for Artificial Intelligence", funded by the European Research Council from 2024-2029. Grant agreement ID: 101142306

// Description of dataset:
A collection of 50 AI-generated stories for each of 252 countries generated by OpenAI’s gpt-4o-mini using the base prompt “Write a 1500 word potential {demonym} story”, with files showing word frequency, protagonists' names and noun phrases for each country.

The dataset can be used to compare the "synthetic imaginaries" (see Pilipet 2023) of the language model and how these shift when it generates stories for different nationalities.

METHODOLOGICAL INFORMATION

// Description of sources and methods used for collection/generation of data:
We created a dataset of stories generated by OpenAI’s gpt-4o-mini by using a Python script to construct prompts that were sent to the OpenAI API. We used Statistics Norway’s list of 252 countries and added denomyms for each country, for example Norwegian for Norway . Our base prompt was  “Write a 1500 word potential {demonym} story”, and we generated 50 stories for each country.

We used a very simple prompt because we wanted to get as close to the language model’s “default” conception of a story as possible. The word “potential” was included because our early tests in 2023 found that without it existing novels were often summarised, which was not what we were looking for. In later iterations we tried dropping the word potential and found that then the stories were usually generated in the language of each country, whereas we wanted them in English for easier analysis. In the final iteration we found that some stories were not generated in English after all. This is an example of how a single word can change the output of an LLM and will always be an issue when using generative AI to create a dataset.

We used the gpt-4o-mini model, with temperature set to 0.8, and started generating the stories on 13th January 2025. It took several days to generate 50 stories for all 252 countries, so the last story was generated on 19th January 2025. We have published the dataset of stories on DataverseNO, with a separate csv file for each country and the following data recorded for each of the stories: a unique Story_ID (formatted as the alpha-2 country code with a number, so NO_1 is the first Norwegian story), the ISO-3361 two letter country code, the county name, the demonym, the full text of the generated story, the full text of the prompt that was used to generated it, the date it was generated, the name of the model and the temperature.

// Methods for processing the data:

- Protagonist names and 50-word summaries of stories were generated using gpt_4o-mini. 
- Word frequency counts and noun phrase frequency counts were done using the Python library TextBlob, v0.19.0
- Sentiment analysis is done using the language model distilbert-base-uncased-emotion from https://huggingface.co/bhadresh-savani/distilbert-base-uncased-emotion 
  distilbert-base-uncased-emotion is a version of Distilbert that is finetuned on an emotion dataset from Twitter.

All scripts for generating the dataset are available at https://github.com/MachineVisionUiB/GPT_stories

// Ethical considerations:
No foreseen ethical issues as the dataset consists of AI-generated texts about non-sensitive issues.

DATA & FILE OVERVIEW
Files are organised in 252 directories, one for each country we generated stories for, with directories named using the alpha-2 country code for the country.
Each directory contains five csv files, where the first two letters of the filename is the alpha-2 country code in capitals.
The first directory when sorted alphabetically is thus AD (for Andorra) and the files in the directory are:

AD/AD_names.csv
AD/AD_noun_phrases.csv
AD/AD_stories.csv
AD/AD_summaries_100.csv
AD/AD_word_freq.csv

The file you are reading, 00_README.txt, is at the top level of the file structure.

// File formats:
- Tables are saved as comma separated csv files
- UTF-8 encoding
- 00_README.txt is a plain text file

// Relationship between files:
The directory names and the prefixes to each file use the ISO-3361 two letter country code, often called alpha-2.
Each story has a unique ID, "Story_ID", that consists of the country code and a number.
A set of stories without a demonym was generated 2025-02-14 and for these we used the letters XX in place of a country code.

// Linking this dataset to other data:
The country codes can be used to connect the dataset to datasets about countries, e.g. the World Bank population numbers or indexes for income levels etc.

// Is this a new version of a previously published dataset? 
No

DATA-SPECIFIC INFORMATION FOR EACH FILE

// File: *_stories.csv (e.g. AG_stories.csv for Andorran stories since AG is the country code for Andorra)
// Description: 50 AI-generated stories with metadata
// Variables:
- Story_ID: A unique identifier for each story (e.g., AG_1, AG_2).
- ISO-3361: The ISO 3166-1 alpha-2 country code (AG for Andorra). Note that the code XX is used to denote stories generated with no demonym.
- Country_Name: The full name of the country.
- Demonym: The term used to refer to people from the country (e.g., Andorran).
- Story: The full text of the AI-generated story.
- Prompt: The exact text of the writing prompt used to generate the story.
- Date: The date on which the story was generated.
- GPT_Model: The AI model used to generate the story (e.g., gpt-4o-mini).
- Temperature: The sampling temperature used for text generation, affecting creativity (higher values lead to more randomness).

// Missing data codes: 
No missing data in these files. However note that the country code for Namibia is NA which could affect some analyses if NA is used to denote missing data.

// File: *_names.csv (e.g. AD_names.csv for names in Andorran stories)
// Description: A list of names that appear in stories from a given country, along with their frequency of occurrence. Note that some names are incorrect, such as "m" for Norwegian stories. We chose to leave these LLM inconsistencies in the dataset.
// Variables:
- Name: The name of the protagonist.
- Count: The number of times the name appears in the dataset.
// Missing data codes: No missing data

// File: *_noun_phrases.csv (e.g. AD_noun_phrases.csv for noun phrases in Andorran stories)
// Description: A list of frequently used noun phrases in stories from a given country, along with their frequency of occurrence.
// Variables:
- Noun Phrase: A two-word noun phrase found in the stories.
- Count: The number of times the noun phrase appears.
// Missing data codes: 
No missing data in these files.

# navnet skal endres til summaries.csv
// File: *_summaries_100.csv (e.g. AD_summaries_100.csv for 100-word summaries of Andorran stories)
// Description: 1500 word AI-generated stories with AI-generated 100-word plot summaries and metadata. This is the same as *_stories.csv with the addition of the summaries.
// Variables:
- Story_ID: A unique identifier for each story (e.g., AD_1, AD_2).
- Summaries: A 50-word summary of the story.
- Prompt: The exact text of the writing prompt used to generate the summary.
- Date: The date on which the summary was generated.
- GPT_Model: The AI model used to generate the summary (e.g., gpt-4o-mini).
- Temperature: The sampling temperature used for text generation, affecting creativity (higher values lead to more randomness).
// Missing data codes: 
No missing data in these files.

// File: *_word_freq.csv (e.g. AD_word_freq.csv for word frequency analysis of Andorran stories)
// Description: A frequency analysis of words appearing in stories from a given country. The
// Variables:
- Word: A word found in the stories.
- Frequency: The number of times the word appears in the dataset.
// Missing data codes:
