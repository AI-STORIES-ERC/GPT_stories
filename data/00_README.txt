// Contributors:
Data generated by Jill Walker Rettberg and Hermann Wigers using API calls to OpenAI's language model gpt-4o-mini. Colin Robinson gave advice on software.

// Kind of data:
Textual data, Tabular data, Descriptive Data

// Date of data collection/generation:
Stories with nationalities: 2025-01-13 to 2025-01-19. 
The 50 stories without an assigned nationality: 2025-02-25.

// Funding sources:
The dataset was developed as part of the ERC Advanced Grant project "AI STORIES: Narrative Archetypes for Artificial Intelligence", funded by the European Research Council from 2024-2029. Grant agreement ID: 101142306

// Description of dataset:
A collection of 50 AI-generated stories for each of 252 countries generated by OpenAI’s gpt-4o-mini using the base prompt “Write a 1500 word potential {demonym} story”, with files showing word frequency, protagonists' names and noun phrases for each country. An extra set of stories is included that was generated with no demonym.

The dataset can be used to compare the "synthetic imaginaries" (see Pilipet et al. 2023) of the language model and how these shift when it generates stories for different nationalities.

SHARING/ACCESS INFORMATION

// Licenses/Restrictions: CC0 1.0

The stories were generated using OpenAI's got-4o-mini language model following their terms of service, and according to these terms of service the human prompter owns the output (see https://openai.com/policies/terms-of-use/). Given that most jurisdictions require human creativity to assign copyright we do not think we could claim copyright in the dataset even if we wanted to. We explicitly waive any claims of copyright by assigning the CC0 1.0 licence.

METHODOLOGICAL INFORMATION

// Description of sources and methods used for collection/generation of data:
We created a dataset of stories generated by OpenAI’s gpt-4o-mini by using a Python script to construct prompts that were sent to the OpenAI API. We used Statistics Norway’s list of 252 countries and added denomyms for each country, for example Norwegian for Norway . Our base prompt was  “Write a 1500 word potential {demonym} story”, and we generated 50 stories for each country.

We used a very simple prompt because we wanted to get as close to the language model’s “default” conception of a story as possible. The word “potential” was included because our early tests in 2023 found that without it existing novels were often summarised, which was not what we were looking for. In later iterations we tried dropping the word potential and found that then the stories were usually generated in the language of each country, whereas we wanted them in English for easier analysis. In the final iteration we found that some stories were not generated in English after all. This is an example of how a single word can change the output of an LLM and will always be an issue when using generative AI to create a dataset.

We used the gpt-4o-mini model, with temperature set to 0.8, and started generating the stories on 13th January 2025. It took several days to generate 50 stories for all 252 countries, so the last story was generated on 19th January 2025. We have published the dataset of stories on DataverseNO, with a separate csv file for each country and the following data recorded for each of the stories: a unique Story_ID (formatted as the alpha-2 country code with a number, so NO_1 is the first Norwegian story), the ISO-3361 two letter country code, the county name, the demonym, the full text of the generated story, the full text of the prompt that was used to generated it, the date it was generated, the name of the model and the temperature.

// Methods for processing the data:

- XX_names.csv: After generating the stories we used gpt-4o-mini to extract protagonist names from each story using the prompt “Identify the name of the main character and only the name of the main character within this story: {STORY}”. 
- XX_noun_phrases.csv: We used the function noun_phrases() from the python library TextBlob to identify noun phrases and their frequency counts for each nationality. For example, the noun phrase “whispering pines” is the most frequent noun phrase in Andorran stories with a count of 68.
- XX_sentiments.csv: Sentiment analysis of the summaries using a transformer model called Distilbert-base-uncased-emotion (Savani 2022).
- XX_summaries.csv: 50-word plot summaries for every story using gpt-4-mini with the prompt “In English, write a 50 word plot summary of this story: [STORY]". The summaries are in English.
- AD/AD_word_freq.csv: We ran simple word frequency analysis using a natural language processing library called spacy that identifies and lemmatizes English words and excludes stop words. 


// Ethical considerations:
No foreseen ethical issues as the dataset consists of AI-generated texts about non-sensitive issues.

DATA & FILE OVERVIEW
Files are organised in 236 directories, one for each country we generated stories for, with directories named using the alpha-2 country code for the country.
Each directory contains six csv files, where the first two letters of the filename is the alpha-2 country code in capitals.
The first directory when sorted alphabetically is thus AD (for Andorra) and the files in the directory are:

AD/AD_names.csv
AD/AD_noun_phrases.csv
AD/AD_sentiments.csv
AD/AD_stories.csv
AD/AD_summaries.csv
AD/AD_word_freq.csv

The file you are reading, 00_README.txt, is at the top level of the file structure.

// File List: 
00_README.txt
country_data.csv
gpt-4o-mini-stories.zip

// File formats:
- Tables are saved as comma separated csv files
- UTF-8 encoding
- 00_README.txt is a plain text file

// Relationship between files:
The directory names and the prefixes to each file use the ISO-3361 two letter country code, often called alpha-2.
Each story has a unique ID, "Story_ID", that consists of the country code and a number.

// Linking this dataset to other data:
The country codes can be used to connect the dataset to datasets about countries, e.g. the World Bank population numbers or indexes for income levels etc, which would allow filtering of data or adding additional information to support analysis. The file country_data.csv provides both alpha-2 and alpha-3 codes to use for such linking.

// Is this a new version of a previously published dataset? 
No

// List of country codes and countries
(Note that the alpha-2 country code for Namibia is NA. Take care when processing data as this is often used to indicate an empty value.)
